\chapter{Module Introduction}
%%% Please amend as needed

{\bf It is necessary for all students of \moduleCode\  to attend 75\% of lab sessions. Students with less than 75\% attendance will fail the module and be given a grade X. This has serious implications, since the allocation of an X grade does not allow you to resit the module and since \moduleCode\  and require you to retake the module at a later date with a further financial penalty.

Naturally, there are occasions when you may not be able to attend a lab session. Usually these absences are due to unforeseen circumstance and can be quickly remedied by doing extra work to catch-up. Prolonged absence due to exceptional circumstances need to be raised with \moduleLeader immediately via email and a deferral request submitted as soon as possible to unihelpdesk.

Students are expected to take an active part in all learning sessions;  lectures, lab sessions, practical classes, seminars and workshops. 

Student attendance is monitored during  \emph{labs},  and any unexplained absences will be followed up via e-mail. If for any reason you are unable to attend a session you must inform the module leader.

To make the most of this module please complete the following every week
\begin{itemize}
\item Read through the notes making a note of any points you need to discuss with your tutor.
\item Complete the set activities before the next session, making a note of any points you need to discuss with your tutor.
\item Go to the module My Learning page, make use of extra material, view the podcasts, and access the activity solutions. Make a note of anything you wish to discuss with your tutor.
\item Complete further reading from the core text online.
\end{itemize}

The module team is committed to support you and your fellow students whilst you undertake this module. In order for you to get the most out of sessions you need to come prepared and ready to contribute. Please ensure that any work set by the team has been completed before workshops. After each class please review what has been covered and make a note of anything you would like clarification on. 

It is important that you are respectful and supportive to your fellow students and tutors. Adopting this approach will create a positive atmosphere within sessions and is something you can use in your professional life.

\chapter{Research Ethics}

    {\it The teaching, learning, assessment and research activities undertaken in this module have been considered and are not likely to require ethical approval. } However, please seek advice if undertaking the module entails carrying out any research activities involving human participants, human data, animals/animal products, precious artefacts, materials or data systems. If you submit work that includes data gathered from or about people, this may be treated as academic misconduct and could lead to fail grade being awarded. Research ethics approval seeks to ensure all research is designed and undertaken according to certain principles of ethical research. These include: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Primary concern must be given to the safety, welfare and dignity of participants, researchers, colleagues, the environment and the wider community 
	\item Consideration of risks should be undertaken before research commences with the aim of minimising risks to those involved â€“ i.e. human participants or animal subjects, colleagues, the environment and the wider community, as well as actual or potential risks to those directly or indirectly affected by the research.
	\item Informed consent should be freely given by participants, and by a trained person when collecting or analysing human tissue (details on accessing and completing online training for gaining informed consent for HTA purposes can be found below in Section 8).
	\item Respect for the privacy, confidentiality and anonymity of participants 
	\item  Consideration of the rights of people who may be vulnerable (by virtue of perceived or actual differences in their social status, ethnic origin, gender, mental capacities, or other such characteristics) who may be less competent or able to refuse to give consent to participate
	\item Researchers have a responsibility to the general public and to their profession; as such they should balance the anticipated benefits of their research against potential harm, misuse or abuse which must be avoided 
	\item Researchers must demonstrate the highest standards of ethical conduct and research integrity. They must work within the limits of their skills, training and experience, and refrain from exploitation, dishonesty, plagiarism, infringement of intellectual property rights and the fabrication of research results. They should declare any actual or potential conflicts of interest, and where necessary take steps to resolve them. 
	\item When using human tissues for research,â€¯Human Tissue Act and Human Tissue Authority (HTA) requirementsâ€¯must be met.â€¯Pleaseâ€¯contact the relevant designated person (DP) in your department or the HTA Designated Individual (DI) (Dr Lucy Ghali - L.Ghali@mdx.ac.uk). Further information is provided below inâ€¯theâ€¯section: "Human Tissue Authority Information", see 'Governanceâ€¯Structure" document and SOPs etc.â€¯Â 
	\item Research should not involve any illegal activity, and researchers must comply with all relevant laws.

		For more information about ethics go to the Middlesex Online Research Ethics (MORE) system which has information and guidance to help you meet the highest standards of ethical research using this link: \url{https://MOREform.mdx.ac.uk}. Information and further guidance on how to complete a research ethics application form (e.g., video guides and templates) can be found on the MORE MyLearning site\footnote{Middlesex University Definition of Research document can be located on this site}: \url{http://mdx.mrooms.net/enrol/index.php?id=12277}(Log in required)

\chapter{Assessment}
%%% Please amend as needed
\textbf{Formative assessment}: Formative assessments do not directly contribute to the overall module mark but they do provide an important opportunity to receive feedback on your learning. They provide an opportunity to evaluate and reflect on your understanding of what you have learnt. They also help your tutors identify what further support and guidance can be given to improve your grade. 

On this module you will have the following formal assessment opportunities: learning weeks 4 and 10\---11.

\textbf{Summative assessment}: Summative assessment is the assessed work that determines the overall module grade. It is the way the University verifies that students have met the learning outcomes at the appropriate level. 

There are \emph{two} assessment components in this module: \emph{Coursework 1 and Coursework 2}.


\section*{Feedback on your assignments}

Feedback will normally be provided within 15 working days of the published assessment component submission date.

\section*{Overall module grade}
%%% Please amend as needed
Each component of assessment will be marked as a percentage. To produce the overall module grade a weighted average percentage will be calculated and then converted to a 20-point grade using the scale below. 

%\newpage
%\begin{center}
%	\begin{sideways}
%		%% \TwentyPointGradeTable produces the correct table for your subject
%		%% Keys:
%		%%		subject		=	MSO or PDE (others can be coded in the .cls file if necessary)

\section*{Assessment process}
\moduleCode is composed of {\it two} in-course assignments. These deadlines are correct, but may be subject to change. Table \ref{ta:cw} shows the important dates associated with each of the in-course assignments. The table also indicates that the assessment weighting, which gives the grand total of 100\%. Your final grade for \moduleCode will be calculated from adding each of these sub-totals for the in-course assignments, which must exceed 39.5\% to pass.


\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
Assessment 	& Formative Feedback 	& Deadline 				& \% \\ \hline\hline
Coursework 1		& Week 4 	& \cwideadline 	& 25 \\ \hline
Coursework 2		& Week 10\---11 & \cwiideadline & 75 \\ \hline
