This project is concerned with using LaTeX for teaching in HE.
There are three folders: hb; lc; cw.
There are definition files in the root directory.
There are bibliographies.

There are many things to do:
 - automate the generation of files and directories for 12 week delivery.
 - create a database to store information about modules
 - generate all material for multiple modules using step above.
 

At the moment the data is just there as an idea of what is required.
