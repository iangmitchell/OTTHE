\section{Introduction}
Consensus Engineering is an important component of decentralised applications and is often overlooked. Deploying the right consensus algorithm is important to the success of your application.

\section{Consensus \& Untrustworthy}
The ``Untrusted University'' has been investigated for given fraudulent degrees, and awarding graduates first class honour, when their results show otherwise. The Vice-Chancellor has given this task to the Deans to solve. The Dean for the Faculty of Humanities suggest trying consensus. As a group we are going to try this and see if it works.


\begin{itemize}
	\item In groups of three
	\item one of you is a primary node
	\item one of you is a trustworthy client node
	\item one of you is a untrustworthy client node
	\item Distribute the message that client S005 received a grade of 43. Follow the PBFT algorithm and determine if this result can be ratified by consensus using three nodes
\end{itemize}


\section{Cosensus \& Trustworthy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In groups of four 
	\item one of you is a primary node
	\item one of you is a trustworthy client node
	\item one of you is a untrustworthy client node
	\item Distribute the message that client S005 received a grade of 43. Follow the PBFT algorithm and determine if this result can be ratified by consensus using four nodes
\end{itemize}
